Hi, Tommaso:
First I propose a plan, then I give some answers to the questions you may ask.
######################
PLAN:
1. Generate dithered images (only arcs) 0.13" and drizzle them to 0.08".
2. Use TINY TIM to generate SUB=9 subsampled PSF, and bin 6 by 6, 
   i.e., to generate AGN 0.13*6/9~0.08.  
3. At a different telescope position, generate SUB=9 subsampled PSF, and
   bin 2 by 2, i.e., to generate PSF 3 times smaller than AGN. 
4. Add AGNs to the arcs. 
5. Add noise, I use (cps/expt+bkg**2)**0.5, cps=counts per second, expt=exposure time.
   For AGN areas (with much larger intense), expt=26*12s, 12 dither patterns, each 26s short exposure 
   for AGN. For other parts in the image, I use expt=1200*2*12s, 2 long exposure with 1200s.
   In short, the noise for AGN is much larger than other parts.
6. "image.fits" is the simulated image, "psfagn.fits" is subsampled PSF, please check.
7. Run GLEE, get "image.001_es001.ps", and I use sum of the source image as the luminosity of the source.
   The range I use to sum is always fixed.
8. The true magnitude of the source is 21.5, if I use the sum of the whole source image, the result is 21.465,
   quite accurate, I guess it is because multiple biases cancel out each other.

Q: Why don't the residuals after subtructing the AGNs look smooth, ie, some outliers in the AGN area?
A: the intense of arc is usualy ~0.2, the noise from AGN is ~0.5, plus the bias from telescope positions,
   the AGN areas have quite small signal-noise ratios for the underneath arcs. In others words, AGN is 1000 brighter, it is 
   very hard to get the faint arc underneath in those areas. Also, these will make the regularisation
   length quite large ~100, I can't abandon these AGN areas, or the algrithm in GLEE will understand this in another way.

Q: Why not use GALFIT to model the source?
A: I have tried many ways, I found the parameters: magnitude, sersic index n and R_e are very sensitive
   to the area I choose to fit, the inverted source resolution. Besides, the result from GLEE is without
   convolution, without noise and x, y for source plane are different, therefore, I am not sure these can 
   match GALFIT, while I used many "none" in GALFIT. In summay, the uncertainy is quite large using GALFIT,
   even much larger that the noise and GLEE, to get a objective and correct answer, I strongly suggest we use the sum of the source,
   and for now it seems stable and accurate.

Q: If we use the sum, should we abandon the AGN areas in lens plan? and 
   since GLEE gives a limited area for the source, what about those far away from the center?
A: We should use the whole area because the regularisatiom algrithm requires us to treat the whole image
   together. If we cut the ANG areas, GLEE will understand in another way, ie, regularise the blanks.
   I admit that we may lose the area far away from the center which could bring little bias, but the philosophy of simulation
   permits this bias as long as we make the simulation process stable: we can use a offset or a reduced 
   coefficient to elimilate this bias in the end. For example, I have a wrong ruler to measure the length 
   of a table, but if we know the bias from the correct ruler, we can still get a correct answer. And 
   the result for the example seems good, may be multiple biases cancel out each other, that is just what we want.

Q: If you use the sum, how about other parameters like sersic index n and R_e of the source?
A: We can totally ignore those, we are curious about the luminosity rather other find a good fit for the
   source.
